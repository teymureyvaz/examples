docs:
  Instead of referring to User directly, you should reference the user model using django.contrib.auth.get_user_model().
  This method will return the currently active user model â€“ the custom user model if one is specified, 
  or User otherwise. When you define a foreign key or many-to-many relations to the user model, 
  you should specify the custom model using the AUTH_USER_MODEL setting.
